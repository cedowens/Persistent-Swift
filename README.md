# Persistent-Swift

This repo is a Swift port of the original PersistentJXA projects by D00MFist (https://github.com/D00MFist/PersistentJXA). 

For my repos, the code that executes the persistence is Swift and I kept the payloads themselves as JXA payloads. 

------------------
## Steps

1. Ensure you have Xcode installed (which will also install Swift)
2. Open the .xcodeproj file of the desired persistence project (ex: AtomPersist) in XCode
3. Make any changes (if desired) and then build in Xcode
4. The build will drop the .app package to something like **~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/[Project-Name]-[random]/Build/Products/Debug/[Project].app**
5. cd into the [Project].app/Content/MacOS directory in #4 above
6. run the macho binary there (ex: ./AtomPersist [path_to_jxa_payload])

## Details

|Project	|          Description                      |	Usage	|Artifacts Created|	Commandline Commands Executed|
|---------|-------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
|AtomPersist | Persistence using the Atom init script. Appends the Atom init script to execute our command. Persistence executes upon Atom opening.| ./AtomPersist [path_to_jxa_payload] | Modification to end of: /System/Volumes/Data/Users/{User}/.atom/init.coffee | N/A|
|Bash_Profile_Persistence |Is really zsh profile persistence as opposed to bash. Modifies user's zsh profile to execute script if the persistence process (current implementation assumes osascript) is not already running. Persistence executes on terminal open. | ./Bash_Profile_Persistence [path_to_jxa_payload] [yes/no] | $HOME/.zshenv If you select "yes" for hidden file creation then: $HOME/.security/apple.sh and $HOME/.security/update.sh | N/A by default. "no" for hidden file creation; option If select "yes" for hidden file creation then: sh $HOME/.security/apple.sh and sh $HOME/.security/update.sh|
|CronJobPersistence | Persistence using CronJobs. This script will create a hidden file (share.sh) inside of .security in the userâ€™s home directory. You can modify the default value of 15 mins by editing the main.swift code. (Note: This command generates a user prompt for Catalina. | ./CronJobPersistence [path_to_jxa_payload] | $HOME/.security/.share.sh, crontab entry| sh -c echo "$(echo '15 * * * * cd $HOME/.security && ./.share.sh' ; crontab -l)" | crontab -, sh -c (Persistence Action)|
|iTermScriptPersistence | Persistence using the iTerm2 application startup script. Appends the application script for iTerm2 to execute our command. If the folder does not exist then one will be created. Persistence executes upon iTerm2 opening. See https://theevilbit.github.io/beyond/beyond_0002/ for more details. | ./iTermAppScriptPersistence [path_to_js_jxa_payload] | creates a new file at /Library/Application Support/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch/iTerm.sh | osascript [path_to_app] &|
|LoginItemPersistence | Persistence by adding an app as a Login Item | ./LoginItemPersistence [app path] [true/false] | Will generate a pop-up if XPC access has not yet been granted from Terminal to System Events, since this implementation leverages System Events via NSAppleScript | N/A, as this uses the NSAppleScript API|
